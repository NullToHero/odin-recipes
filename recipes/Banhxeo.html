        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <p><strong>Dipping Sauce</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine water and sugar in a bowl. You can heat 1/3 of the water to dissolve the sugar easier, add the rest of the remaining water once the sugar is dissolved fully</li>
                    <li>Add lime or lemon juice in increments until you like how your current mixture taste</li>
                    <li>Add fish sauce in small increments until you get to your preferred taste, the sauce will be a bit strong</li>
                    <li>Add the minced garlic and sliced bird's eye</li>
                </ol>

        <p><strong>Batter Preparation</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine all batter ingredients except scallions in a large bowl for three hours minimum (overnight preferably). Add scallions right before making the crepes</li>
                </ol>

        <p><strong>Filling Preparation</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Steam or soak mung beans in water until soft (disregard if you omitted)</li>
                    <li>Boil pork belly until cooked through and soft, slice thinly</li>
                    <li>Devein and boil shrimp (be careful not to overcook, 2-3 minutes depending on size), slice shrimp in half, length wise</li>
                    <li>Wash bean sprouts and vegetables</li>
                </ol>

        <p><strong>Making the Banh Xeo (roughly 8-10 minute cooking time each crepe)</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>On medium-high heat add 1-2 teaspoons of oil and some sliced onions</li>
                    <li>Immediately add a few pieces of pork and shrimp (omit for allergies). Saute, lightly mixing until very lightly browned and fragrant</li>
                    <li>Pour in the prepared batter and quickly tilt and rotate the pan so the batter is evenly spread. Add more batter if there's not enough to cover the pan. There should only be a thin layer of batter that almost flakes off at the pan's edges where it's thinner. If your batter doesn't do that and seems too thick, add a few tbsp of water to the batter and mix to thin it out.</li>
                    <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add some mung beans (optional), beansprouts, and cover with a lid for roughly three minutes, or until the bean sprouts are slightly cooked. The batter should also be slightly cooked andtransparent around the edges. This step cooks the top side of the ingredientsand batter while it steams since we are not flipping the crepe</li>
                    <li>Remove the lid, lower the heat to medium-low and wait for the crepe to crisp up. This will take roughly 5-7 minutes. This steplets the ingredients fully cook through, including the batter. It will also allow steam to escape and aid with the crepe's crisping process. Brush on a little oil around the edge if you don't see enough contact between the crepe and pan. Fold the banh xeo in half, transfer to a plate and serve immediately with chosen vegetables and dipping sauce</li>
                </ol>
